/**
 * This class represents a document created in [DocumentStore].
 *
 * Documents in this store are identified by a name which must be unique
 * per document.
 *
 * Arbitrary data can be stored in documents using the [ApplicationData] returned
 * by [.getApplicationData] which supports key/value pairs with typed values
 * including raw blobs, strings, booleans, numbers, and [NameSpacedData].
 * This data is persisted for the life-time of the document.
 *
 * One typical use of [ApplicationData] is for using it to store the alias
 * of a [SecureArea] key used for communicating with the Issuing Authority
 * issuing data for the document and and proving - via the attestation on the key - that
 * the device is in a known good state (e.g. verified boot is enabled, the OS is at a
 * sufficiently recent patch level, it's communicating with the expected Android
 * application, etc).
 *
 * Each document may have a number of *Credentials*
 * associated with it. These credentials are intended to be used in ways specified by the
 * underlying document format but the general idea is that they are created on
 * the device and then sent to the issuer for certification. The issuer then returns
 * some format-specific data related to the credential.
 *
 * Using Mobile Driving License and MDOCs according
 * to [ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021](https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html) as an example,
 * the credential plays the role of *DeviceKey* and the issuer-signed
 * data includes the *Mobile Security Object* which includes the
 * credential and is signed by the issuer. This is used for anti-cloning and to return data signed
 * by the device. The way it works in this API is that the application can create an [MdocCredential]
 * (using [MdocCredential.create]) tied to a [Document]. With this in hand, the application can use
 * [MdocCredential.attestation] and send the attestation
 * to the issuer for certification. The issuer will then craft document-format
 * specific data (for ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021 it will be a signed MSO which references
 * the public part of the newly created credential) and send it back
 * to the app. The application can then call
 * [Credential.certify] which would add any issuer provided authentication data to the
 * credential and make it ready for use in presentation. To retrieve all credentials
 * which still require certification, use [pendingCredentials], and to retrieve all
 * certified credentials, use [certifiedCredentials].
 *
 * At document presentation time the application first receives the request
 * from a remote reader using a specific document presentation protocol, such
 * as ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021. The details of the document-specific request includes
 * enough information (for example, the *DocType* if using ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021)
 * for the application to locate a suitable [Document] from a [DocumentStore].
 * See [DocumentRequest] for more information about how to generate the response for
 * the remote reader given a [Document] instance.
 *
 * There is nothing mDL/MDOC specific about this type, it can be used for any kind
 * of document regardless of format, presentation, or issuance protocol used.
 *
 * @param name the name of the document which can be used with [DocumentStore].
 * @param storageEngine the [StorageEngine] to use for storing/retrieving documents.
 * @param secureAreaRepository the repository of configured [SecureArea] that can
 * be used.
 * @param store the [DocumentStore] which holds this document.
 * @param credentialFactory the [CredentialFactory] to use for retrieving serialized credentials
 * associated with documents.
